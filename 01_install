From windows we use Rufus:
Default settings -> tap start -> download requirements -> Write in ISO image mode. 
On older systems you might need to use the "bootia32.efi". Place it unde Boot/efi on the USB.

From Linux we use _ _ _ _:

Access bios (Del, F4, etc..). 
Boot from usb using UEFI: 'usb drive'.

*Always install Linux after Windows ** Use ext4 as your file system - One of the most stable and best in the world. *** Use linuxswap for the swap partition. 

PARTITION TABLE
  GPT - on newer system

BOOT PARTITION - ("/boot, /boot/efi") Fat32
  You do not need to have a /boot partition. However, it's good to have for flexibility reasons (LVM, encryption, BIOS limitations). 
  "boot/efi" - 512 MiB first patrition. 
  
SWAP - ("swap") linuxswap
  A partition used to augment your RAM, mounted and referred to as swap. Use 1.5-2 times the amount of sytem ram if you want to hybernate. But less is ok (4GB should do). 
  16GB Ram = 16384MiB

ROOT PARTITION - ("/") ext4
  Check your distribution’s documentation, and reserve enough space for a maximum installation, plus at least 100MB more for temporary space and installation of new software. 
  If you plan to download and try out lots of software, leave more space. If you have a small hard drive, you can trim back on your installed packages to save space.
  12 - 20 GB partition for the OS. 
  30 GiB = 30720 MiB

HOME - ("/home") ext4
  A larger partition for personal use, mounted as /home
  100 GiB = 102400 MiB

OPTIONAL: Recomended to make partitions after install. See Setup and Termilal doc. 
  Create a partition for Timeshift and Desktop settings.
  50 GiB = 51200 MiB 
  You can also make a FAT32 partition which gives me a nice area to share files between Linux and Windows without worrying about one not being overly happy with NTFS and the other not being at all happy with EXT4.

MANJARO 
https://www.fosslinux.com/2404/installing-a-updatable-manjaro-linux-on-a-usb-flash-drive.htm

Requirements
A bootable Manjaro USB or CD, which is the installer in our case
Another USB with at least 16 GB size that will be used to install Manjaro on it

Partition type
This one of the most critical steps, here you will be able to select the USB to install the MBR (Master Boot Record) on it. (Be careful; if you choose any other option than the USB, this definitely will cause an error later.)

	NOTE: Pick MBR if you dont plane on going with the multi boot, see below. 
	Manjaro efi guide - https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=UEFI_-_Install_Guide

Create three partitions
First partition is the “/boot/efi”. 
The second partition is “/”. 
The third partition is the "swap" partition.

Hybrid UEFI GPT + BIOS GPT/MBR boot - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Multiboot_USB_drive
This configuration is useful for creating a universal USB key, bootable everywhere. First of all you must create a GPT partition table on your device. You need at least 3 partitions:

0.1 - A BIOS boot partition (gdisk type code EF02). This partition must be 1 MiB in size
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPT_fdisk

	You only need a BIOS boot partition with a GPT partition table and you intend to use grub. I'm not clear if that is what you are using or not.

	The BIOS boot partition doesn't get mounted and doesn't need formatting or a file system. It is just somewhere grub uses when it installs to disk and it finds it automatically.

	If you want a regular boot partition, you need to create a separate partition for that with a regular file system type and of a reasonable size. ext4 is a perfectly good choice for /boot (I use it for my /boot) but you will need something bigger than 1MB!
	- - - - 

0.2 - An EFI System partition (gdisk type code EF00 with a FAT32 filesystem). This partition can be as small as 50 MiB.

0.3 - Your data partition (use a filesystem supported by GRUB). This partition can take up the rest of the space of your drive.

	NOTE: Flags was not important ?!
